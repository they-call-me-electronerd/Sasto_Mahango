> *"Sasto Mahango"* translates to **"Cheap & Expensive"** in Nepali - your ultimate tool for finding the best grocery deals in Kathmandu!

## 📋 Platform Overview

Sasto Mahango is a dynamic **Product and Price Index** platform designed to bring transparency to the marketplace. In a retail environment where shopkeepers may quote arbitrary prices and online stores often mark up goods ("over prize"), consumers frequently pay more than the item's true worth.

**Our Mission:** To help users find the best products at **affordable and actual market rates** by providing fair price transparency.

### How It Works

*   **Fair Price Discovery:** We provide the **average or actual price** of products, helping you avoid overpaying. You can check the real market rate before you buy.
*   **Empowered Agent Network:** Our data is crowdsourced and promoted by a diverse network of **Agents**—including students, shopkeepers, and wholesalers.
*   **Business Promotion:** Agents can promote their own businesses and shops by adding items and prices to the platform.
*   **Incentivized Contribution:** Agents earn specific incentives for completing data collection targets ("intensives") and expanding the product index.
*   **Verified Trust:** Administrators and key contributors are **verified by Sponsors**, ensuring that the data on our web platform is reliable and trustworthy.
